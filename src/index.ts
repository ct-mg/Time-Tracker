/**
 * ChurchTools Extension Boilerplate
 *
 * Main exports for the extension library
 *
 * This file supports both build modes:
 * - Simple mode: Use loadEntryPoint() - entry points bundled together
 * - Advanced mode: Use loadEntryPoint() - entry points code-split on demand
 *
 * Using loadEntryPoint() works optimally in both modes:
 * - Simple mode: Returns pre-loaded entry points immediately
 * - Advanced mode: Dynamically imports and code-splits entry points
